Website Link: https://ecommbookstore.netlify.app 

The **MERN-based** e-commerce platform is designed to help bookstores run their online business more efficiently by offering a seamless and straightforward user experience for browsing and purchasing books, with secure user authentication to ensure authorized access. The integrated Razorpay payment gateway ensures secure transactions, automatically adjusting order status and book stock in the database upon successful payment. Administrators benefit from an effective management panel that allows control over various operations, including adding new books and tracking orders, ensuring comprehensive and streamlined management of the bookstore's online operations.

The application seamlessly integrates back-end and front-end components using the **MERN stack**, delivering a unified and responsive user experience. **MongoDB Atlas** ensures reliable and scalable data storage, while **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS** enable a robust back-end architecture for handling authentication, data management, and order processing. On the front end, **ReactJS** enhances user engagement with a dynamic and interactive interface, facilitating an easy browsing and shopping experience.
